# Power Systems Library

## **Overview**
The **Power Systems Library** is a Python-based framework for performing various power system analyses and calculations. It is designed to support all aspects of power system studies, including power flow, stability, contingency, and fault analysis. The library provides a flexible, modular structure that allows users to easily add new IEEE standard test systems, algorithms, and functionalities.

## **Features**
- Support for **IEEE standard test systems**: Includes data for IEEE 14-bus, 30-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus test systems. Extendable to other systems.
- Core analyses:
  - Power flow analysis (Newton-Raphson, Gauss-Seidel, Fast-Decoupled methods)
  - Fault analysis
  - Stability analysis
  - Contingency analysis
- Modular and reusable components: Includes buses, branches, generators, loads, and their respective attributes.
- Flexible Y-bus and admittance matrix computation.
- Extensible: Add custom algorithms, test systems, and data as needed.
- Ready-to-use example scripts and datasets for quick learning and application.
